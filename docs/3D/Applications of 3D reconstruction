Rendering

* Albedo: The characteristic color of an object is called albedo in computer graphics.

Simulating the appearance of an object requires to answer one question only: how much
light does an object reflect back to the eye ( or any other direction for that matter 
which is particularly useful when indirect lighting in computed), over the total amount
it receives.

Shader: if the object is made of wood, if this wood has this given color and this given 
        roughness, if some quality of light impinges upon this object from the direction wi,
        how much of that light would be reflected by this object back in the environment in 
        the direction wv?


From 3D objects to 2D image:
1. Computing the Pixel Coordinates of a 3D Point
2. Computing the appearance of the 3D objects in image
3. Determine which points are visible
